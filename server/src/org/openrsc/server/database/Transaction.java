/**
 * <code>Transactions</code> are units of database interaction that 
 * may be submitted to a DatabaseService.  Special care must be taken 
 * such that multiple <code>Transactions</code> do not rely on each-other 
 * to function correctly, as there is no guarantee that multiple 
 * <code>Transactions</code> will be processed A) in order, and 
 * B) atomically by the underlying database driver.
 * 
 * <strong> Transactions may not return integers from 0 - 15, as those values 
 * are reserved for internal use.  Failure to comply may lead to 
 * strange behavior!
 *
 * All queries contained  within a <code>Transaction</code> must handle 
 * their own synchronization in respect to the parts of the database that 
 * they access.</strong>  Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SELECT * FROM `users` FOR UPDATE
 * ...after lock has been obtained...update users...
 * </pre>
